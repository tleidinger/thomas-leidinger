Hey, I'm Thomas Leidinger - a software development manager with proven experience in leading and growing teams. As a people manager I see myself as a solution-oriented engineering leader who understands how to motivate the team, how to keep projects on track and measure the right KPIs and OKRs.

I do have a passion for agile software development with a healthy dose of pragmatism. I do emphasize on both building things right and building the right things with the help of focused and effective processes and procedures.
